# Smart home control

this application is a frontend interface of a smart home application that allows the user to control diffrent devices in the house. app is still in progress.

## ToDo
* Add tabs for seperate rooms.
* Connect to data base (build the backend).

## How it works

from the home.dart we call the custom buttons that are found in the button.dart, these custom buttons are made so that they have a switch that toggle on touch and change colors from grey(off) and green(on).
